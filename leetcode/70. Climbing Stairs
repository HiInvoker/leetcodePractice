You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int

        a, b = 1, 1

        for i in range(2, n):
            a, b = b, a+b

        return b

n = 1    1
n = 2    2
n = 3    1(2) + 2(1)  走1步剩下2层，走2步剩下1层
n = 4    1(3) + 2(2)
